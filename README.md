### 💻 SR Terminal

> **Live Demo**: [sr-terminal.vercel.app](https://sr-terminal.vercel.app)

A high-performance web-based operating system capable of running Node.js entirely in the browser using WebContainers.

- **Tech Stack**: Next.js 16, WebContainer API, XTerm.js, Monaco Editor, Zustand.
- **Features**:
  - **In-Browser VM**: Full Node.js 18 runtime without a server.
  - **Multi-Terminal**: Tabbed shell interface for parallel sessions.
  - **Cinematic UX**: Aerospace-themed design with custom modals and resource monitor.
  - **File Management**: Create, edit, download, and run JS files locally.

### 🧠 SR Mesh

> _Coming Soon_

A local-first 3D knowledge graph that uses client-side AI to generate embeddings and cluster notes semantically.

- **Tech Stack**: Next.js 16, Transformers.js (WebAssembly), React Three Fiber, IndexedDB.
- **Features**:
  - **Local AI**: 100% privacy-focused, runs `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` entirely in the browser.
  - **3D Visualization**: Interactive force-directed graph with physics-based particles.
  - **Semantic Search**: Find related notes by meaning, not just keywords.
  - **Performance**: Off-main-thread inference using Web Workers.
